## Housing {#housing}
The Netherlands has been dealing with a severe housing crisis for several years now. (link) Local universities are advising foreign students not to enrol or accept a place before having secured housing. Moreover, owners are most of the time reluctant to rent their places to students, which are considered a risk.

However, all hope isn't lost! There are multiple ways that you, as a student, can still find a suitable place to stay, depending on your needs.
